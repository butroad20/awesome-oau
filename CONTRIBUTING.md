This is an open and collaborative project, and any suggestions for improvement are very welcome.

If you're making a pull request, please ensure it adheres to the following guidelines:

1. Only projects made by active OAU students are welcome.
2. Project must be publicly accessible. If the project is private, a link to a demo/website/video should be included.
3. Check if the link is working and pointing to the right location.  
4. Check your spelling and grammar.
5. Choose the corresponding section.
6. The list, after your addition, should be sorted alphabetically.
7. Make an individual pull request for each project suggestion.
8. If you use a text editor to fashion the pull request, make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
9. New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization, are welcome.
10. Search the existing list before making a new PR, as the project may already be listed.
11. Use the following format for the commit message: `Add Project Project-Name`.
12. Keep descriptions short, sweet and to the point.
13. Use the following format: `[Name](link) - Description.` keep the length of the name + description under 100 characters

## Dead Link Policy

We check for dead links. If links die, we remove them. We'd be happy to accept PRs to re-add new links.
